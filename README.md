# TelevisaUnivision Digital Analyst Portfolio Project

##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates automated reporting, data engineering, and visualization capabilities for a Digital Analyst role. It simulates a digital ad campaign environment to generate insights, calculate pacing metrics, and identify at-risk campaigns using Python.

## Key Features
- **Automated Data Generation**: Creates a synthetic dataset of 100 digital ad campaigns with realistic parameters (Impressions, Budget, Platforms).
- **Pacing & Anomaly Detection**: Implements business logic to calculate 'Pacing %' and automatically flag campaigns that are under-pacing (<90%) or over-pacing (>110%).
- **AI Insight Agent**: Simulates an AI-driven recommendation engine that prescribes specific actions (e.g., "Increase bid caps") based on campaign status.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: detailed Plotly visualizations including:
    -   Revenue at Risk Analysis
    -   Deadline Urgency Heatmap
    -   "High Stakes" Client Scatter Plot
    -   eCPM Efficiency Gauge

## Files
- `televisa_colab_project.py`: The main Python script. Designed to be run locally or in Google Colab. contains all logic for data generation, analysis, and visualization.
- `Televisa_Digital_Analyst_Dashboard.html`: An interactive HTML dashboard generated by the script, containing all 4 visualizations.
- `simulated_data/`: Folder containing the exported CSV dataset (`televisa_campaign_data.csv`).

## How to Run
1.  **Local Execution**:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas plotly numpy
    python televisa_colab_project.py
    ```
2.  **Google Colab**:
    Simply copy the contents of `televisa_colab_project.py` into a Google Colab cell and execute.

## Visualizations
The project generates an interactive dashboard highlighting:
- **Revenue at Risk**: Total budget tied to at-risk campaigns, broken down by platform.
- **Urgency Heatmap**: Identifying which platforms are falling behind as deadlines approach.
- **Client Health**: A scatter plot identifying large-budget clients that are off-track.
